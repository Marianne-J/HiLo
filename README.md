# Overview

This is a game of HiLo, based on a version of the game I helped write previously. The program randomly generates a number and the player guesses whether the next number will be higher or lower than that number. If the user guesses correctly, they earn points. If they guess incorrectly, they lose points. The game ends either when the player chooses to quit, or the number of points reaches zero.

My purpose in writing this program was to learn how to and practice programming in the Java programming language.
